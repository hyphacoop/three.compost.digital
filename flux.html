description: "Jakarta had drowned and for two decades she was claimed by the sea, until the government engaged architects who made Palm Jumeirah and Jebel Ali to design a semi-Atlantis. We flew to Garut where the new airport had been built on the reclaimed lands around Mount Papandayan, now extinct and near sea level, before taking a private boat to Jakarta."
