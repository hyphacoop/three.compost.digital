<p style="text-align:start">Chantal is a novice poet and writer, born and raised in Kenya. Her itinerant upbringing has instilled in her a unique appreciation of the cultures and natural beauty of all the places she has temporarily called home.</p><p style="text-align:start">After a cup or two of tea in the morning, Chantal settles into her work managing social media accounts and fundraising efforts for an orphanage in Malawi. During her own time, she can be found hunched over her sewing projects or taking her four dogs out for some much appreciated exercise.</p><p style="text-align:start">While this may be her first published work, she looks forward to showcasing many more pieces, inclusive of native traditions with elements of magical realism—a key feature in her writing.</p>
