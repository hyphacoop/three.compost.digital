<p>There’s something very wrong with status-quo culture, starting with the fact that such a thing exists in the first place. How has a culture that directly conflicts with the very essence of being human—being part of planet Earth—become the default? Don’t worry, I won’t attempt to explore the history of patriarchy, the state, or capitalism. The fact is that this system has colonized most of humanity through tools that serve the centralization of power. That might be a very natural thing for animals such as ourselves, but it doesn’t really contribute much to gender and cultural diversity, the rest of the planet, survival, or quality of life, does it?</p><p>It’s tempting to think that it’s always been like this: One culture to control them all. But it’s taken thousands of years of colonization for civilizations to develop themselves into this global coercion machine.</p><p>Some argue that the need for civilizations to import ever more resources stems from their overexploitation and diminution of their own local resources. Therefore, civilizations adopt imperialist and expansionist policies and, to maintain these highly militarized, hierarchically structured, and coercion-based cultures and lifestyles.</p><p>It sure seems that we’re at the peak of it—power is more concentrated than ever, and the symptom is the collapse we are experiencing today. Due to the near ubiquity of this oppressive culture, we have almost no choice to operate outside of it.</p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>“<em>We know that Mother Nature has a culture, and it is a Native culture</em>” Yupiaq scholar, Oscar Kawagley <a href="https://two.compost.digital/uncivilizing-digital-territories/#footnote-block-2" rel="noopener" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin">[1]</a></p></blockquote><p>Alternatives to the civil monoculturing still exist and resist even in the face of states and corporations that work to extinguish and assimilate them. Contrary to civilization, many Cultures of the Earth still operate in harmony with larger systems. Such cultures thrive and build systems of abundance, such as forests. Indigenous cultures teach us that living with cultural and biological diversity is not only possible, but also the best way to survive long term.</p><p>We, civilized people, have been brought up to understand ourselves in relation to nations that are built on stolen land, mass genocide, and the exploitation of human and non-human life; but, given a chance, can we choose to contribute to building tools of solidarity and community, rather than individualism and coercion?</p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>“Our familiar “technologies” were developed in the context of conquest and central control and runaway exploitation and the numbness to make it all tolerable. We have the ones we have because they fed back into these habits, and they would continue to do so.” Ran Prieur <a href="https://two.compost.digital/uncivilizing-digital-territories/#footnote-block-3" rel="noopener" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin">[2]</a></p></blockquote><p>Digital technologies are perhaps too powerful. They are used for connecting distant loved ones and learning, while also for turning people into dopamine junkies <a href="https://two.compost.digital/uncivilizing-digital-territories/#footnote-block-4" rel="noopener" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin">[3]</a> and spreading disinformation <a href="https://two.compost.digital/uncivilizing-digital-territories/#footnote-block-5" rel="noopener" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin">[4]</a>. But they can also help strengthen communities and their resistances.</p><p>We have been involved for years with the community-networks <a href="https://two.compost.digital/uncivilizing-digital-territories/#footnote-block-community-networks" rel="noopener" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin">[5]</a> movement and with organizations like Coolab <a href="https://two.compost.digital/uncivilizing-digital-territories/#footnote-block-coolab" rel="noopener" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin">[6]</a> and Digital-Democracy <a href="https://two.compost.digital/uncivilizing-digital-territories/#footnote-block-digital-democracy" rel="noopener" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin">[7]</a>. We work closely with local communities developing communication and information technologies in collaboration with them. By identifying and understanding needs and cultural traits that are specific to each locality, we can develop practices, software, and hardware that are aligned with their values.</p><h2 id="collective-digital-networks">Collective Digital Networks</h2><p>Digital experiences start with hardware. Default options are market-driven personal devices, privately controlled wired and wireless networks, and huge centralized server warehouses.</p><p>Devices and infrastructures with the goal of providing autonomy for communities must have accessibility, distribution of responsibility, and of data guardianship as priorities. And special care must be taken not to force patterns of assimilation.</p>
