title: peripheries of mischief
description: In the 1930s in Wicklow, Ireland, a valley was evacuated flooded to create
  a reservoir and an electricity generating station at Poulaphuca. Animals, humans,
  trees, fungi, birds and fish were all displaced or replaced. So too were myths and
  histories. This essay considers the entanglement of myth, ecology and technology
  at the reservoir.
