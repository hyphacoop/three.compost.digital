The unlimited potentiality of water is always defined by the material reality of its surroundings.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="public/zt54vtc7qgihnmqffbxk1964hlys/water_transparent_4.png" class="max-w-100" controls="false"></figure><p style="text-align:center">When we define a body of water, we omit its endless states of potential being. Definition makes us forget how easily we can scoop sea into glass.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="public/npj5wzkkkwef2ofykdt5tp4yy5hh/water_transparent_6.png" class="max-w-100" controls="false"></figure><p style="text-align:center">But it’s hard to relate to the infinite.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:center">We seek to communicate the singularity of our experience, and it’s the limits and the peculiarities of a thing that give it character. The more unique, the more novel, a thing is, the more it will catch our eye.</p><figure><img src="public/th1jf2y88zjljuhut9bh66gmtgmc/water_dividers_transparent_1.png" class="max-w-100" controls="false"></figure><p style="text-align:center">With this in mind, I began my sketches for <em>COMPOST</em>. I like to use simple ways of working, and I wanted to focus on light and shadow. Everything was drawn with an 0.7 mechanical pencil in a Rhodia sketchbook. I love texture, but my drawings seem to turn out better on smooth paper. Sometimes I like to add digital texture; lately my favorite method is using a scan of cold pressed watercolor paper as a Multiply layer.</p><figure><img src="public/ulqjky4j3rqnwteeyp504cq205ky/water_dividers_transparent_3.png" class="max-w-100" controls="false"></figure><p style="text-align:center">As I set out on my visual studies, I found myself thinking of all the bodies of water I have coexisted with. I was lucky to have a childhood where access to water was abundant. I grew up on an island in California. My dad was a surfer, and I remember summers full of swimming lessons and trips to the beach. Whenever I was immersed in water, I found myself transfixed by the shimmering gradations of light around me. And the sharp sparkling clarity of a pool on a scorching day is so different from the silky darkness of a redwood forest’s river.</p><figure><img src="public/wufad4i3br1nc4go04m97ihr6bx8/water_transparent_10.png" class="max-w-100" controls="false"></figure><p style="text-align:center">I used to imagine I was a being of water, some aquatic nymph that could receive messages from the tide. I had a book of fairytales that contained an old version of <em>The Little Mermaid</em>; in the end, the soulless mermaid dies and dissolves into seafoam.</p><figure><img src="public/4qjrbffusrf9wizmvdkxutywfaqs/water_transparent_12.png" class="max-w-100" controls="false"></figure><p style="text-align:center">I thought about what it would be like to have water as my body. I would lap at an overcast shore until the end of time, the hollow sound of waves my only language. The image stuck in my mind as a continual fixture; somehow, it seemed like a plausible fate for my own life.</p><figure><img src="public/nsld1as0acvdwt3qijx04vku2akv/water_transparent_2.png" class="max-w-100" controls="false"></figure><p style="text-align:center">What would it mean to be an infinite nothingness?</p><figure><img src="public/unyxn8mjrzm13l5y3o2q6tm5ln6r/water_transparent_9_smaller.png" class="max-w-100" controls="false"></figure><p style="text-align:center">Like water, the internet also exists both in its reality and its potential. The internet could be any form of data shared by a protocol — infinite shapes wait to be conjured from the nothingness of cyberspace. Yet we rarely look beyond the internet’s common forms: a web page, an email attachment, a TikTok. <em>COMPOST</em>, a publication existing on the distributed web, seems like a step into a different virtual reality — an uncommon form that makes you dream of things that could be.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="public/gm6miaaehp04ortirkqi4ghdnt3u/water_dividers_transparent_4.png" class="max-w-100" controls="false"></figure><figure><img src="public/iu9uj4cqe2tsro29joshfh7nib2r/water_dividers_transparent_2.png" class="max-w-100" controls="false"></figure><p style="text-align:center">Is there anything more fascinating than the process of creation? Holding an idea in your mind and taking the steps necessary to see it to fruition?&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="public/3ibdh5riodnc2k3vpp1t9ha7ndxe/water_transparent_7_smaller.png" class="max-w-100" controls="false"></figure><p style="text-align:center">My drawings are only a series of lines, placed one by one — a tangible image slowly created out of intangible thoughts. Once a drawing is complete, I’m already thinking of the next. The drive to imagine what hasn’t yet been made, I think, is inherent in all of us. It’s hard to imagine a more worthwhile pursuit than one that takes us further and further into the unknown, forever striving to bring to reality what we see just up ahead.</p><figure><img src="public/p3zot79ftr63ymxsyhyn4c9gvpm8/water_transparent_5.png" class="max-w-100" controls="false"></figure><p style="text-align:center"></p>
