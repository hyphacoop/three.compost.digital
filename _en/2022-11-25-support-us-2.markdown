section_1: <h2 id="digital-bake-sale">Digital Bake Sale</h2><p>We need your support
  to ensure the future sustainability of our magazine and <a href="https://distributed.press"

  magazine has CAD $7,325.64 in our bank account as of Friday, November 25, 2022.
  We hope to raise $30,000 by August 1st of 2021 and before launching Issue Two.</p><p><a

section_2: |-
  <p>Beyond these goals, additional funds will give all contributors, artists, and designers a $200 bonus and any remaining funds will be used in the development of future COMPOST issues.</p><h2 id="web-monetization">Web Monetization</h2><p>Readers shouldn’t have to wade through intrusive ads or paywalls to read this magazine. We don’t want your data nor do we want to restrict access to COMPOST. <a href="https://webmonetization.org/" rel="noopener" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin">Web Monetization</a> is another way for supporters like you to send us micropayments (fractions of a cent) as you view this website.</p><h3 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h3><p>Web Monetization is an emerging standard for web browsers. At the moment, you need to download a browser extension to make it work. We’ve found that getting a <a href="https://coil.com/signup" rel="noopener" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin">Coil membership</a> is the easiest way to get started with Web Monetization. With a $5 monthly membership, you can also support hundreds of other Web Monetization websites like <a href="https://cinnamon.video" rel="noopener" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin">Cinnamon</a>, <a href="https://www.ampled.com" rel="noopener" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin">Ampled</a>, <a href="https://eraseallkittens.com" rel="noopener" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin">Erase All Kittens</a>, and <a href="https://www.ladyspikemedia.com" rel="noopener" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin">Ladyspike Media</a>.</p><h3 id="setup-coil">Setup Coil</h3><table><tbody><tr>

  <li><p>Visit <a href="https://coil.com/signup" rel="noopener" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin">https://coil.com/signup</a> and signup.</p></li>
  <li><p>Go to Settings and enter the "Membership" menu item.</p></li>
  <li><p>Add your credit card and subscribe. It's $5 a month.</p></li>
  <li><p>Download the extension for any browser of your choice.</p></li>
