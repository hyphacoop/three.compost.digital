<p>COMPOST is a magazine about the digital commons. We curate art, reflections, and experiments about building the web as a shared resource with active stewards.</p><p>We approach COMPOST as a process to metabolize and renew our relationships with the web, to imagine and build interdependent, equitable, and solidarity-based systems of communication and knowledge sharing.</p><p>If you like what weâ€™re doing, please consider becoming a <a href="https://opencollective.com/compost/contribute/backer-22573/checkout" rel="noopener" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin">subscriber</a>, contributing <a href="https://opencollective.com/compost" rel="noopener" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin">money</a> (or crypto through <a href="https://gitcoin.co/grants/1385/compost" rel="noopener" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin">Gitcoin</a> or directly to <code>compostmag.eth</code>), and supporting us through <a href="https://two.compost.digital/support-us/#web-monetization" rel="noopener" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin">Web Monetization</a>.</p><h2 id="experiments-with-publishing">Experiments with Publishing</h2><h3 id="issues-and-labs">Issues and Labs</h3><p>We treat each issue of COMPOST as a lab.

Over the summer of 2021, our Issue Two cohort has been thinking about creative collaboration, collectively supporting livelihoods, and growing our community sustainably.</p><h3 id="a-distributed-press">A Distributed Press</h3><p>We want creators to have more control over the means of digital publishing.
