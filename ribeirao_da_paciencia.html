                <p>For the writing of this piece we walked along the Ribeirão da Paciência, one of
                    the main rivers in our neighborhood. We literally walked in the river, got our feet wet
                    and hydrated our ideas.
                    We walked in search for the intersections between our common goods: the water and the
                    internet, in the small scale in which it presents itself in our surroundings.</p>
                <p>We are in Monteiro Lobato, in the Serra da Mantiqueira, a mountain range in
                    southeastern Brazil known for its waters, as its indigenous name implies:
                    Mantiqueira , the mountains that cry.</p>
                <p>Follow our report and reflections about the path of water and information.</p>

                            But between water and internet we have a fundamental difference: Water does not
                            belong to us as humanity, it is an interspecies common good belonging to all the
                            plurality of life forms that inhabit the earth, and it is perfect just the way it is; whereas
                            the internet is created by and for the benefit (we hope) of only the human species
                            through the manipulation of a bunch of natural resources.</p>

                                The internet infrastructure is made up of many
                                layers and technologies. The simplest are

                                infrastructure is via radio, the possibility to send

                                legislation.

                                In the case of Brazil, the legislation allows the use of certain
                                frequencies for certain purposes, purposes thoses that fits
                                inside the limited normativity that the decision-makers can

                                imagine.

                                Not even the spectrum is free.

                                But the most robust part of the internet infrastructure is right
                                inside the oceans. It is huge fiber optic cables, that
                                extraordinary invention, that reconfigure the marine
                                constitution into a perfect picture of the Anthropocene.

                                To be water is to flow, to adapt;
                                it is to occupy the lowest places;
                                it is to nourish life wherever it passes.
                                The path that water takes is not always

                                In Brazil all waters
                                belong to the Union or
                                to the states. There is

                                the waters, and no
                                municipal management.
                                Brazil follows a water

                                the example of France

                                passage, but the water remains
                                flowing.

                                            We dont get to sea, but at the same
                                            instant we drink the sprout`s water,
                                            the river arrives the sea
                                            Sea deep is mistery
                                            The water origin and its destiny is the
                                            mystery
                                            Our origin and our destiny is the
                                            mistery
                                            May the path we walk, between our
                                            origin and destination be like the path
                                            of water.</p>

                                                    moved by need and thirst, go on an adventure
                                                    to search water.</p>

                                                    <p>We like the challenging moment when our lives have
                                                        sprouted.
                                                        We seek to transist because we see giant
                                                        possibilities to transform. We want to embrace the
                                                        individualism that has made us understand so much
                                                        of our essences and create new ways of caring
                                                        together. We want small managements that can
                                                        apply all the knowledge already created globally, but
                                                        that is decided locally by those who matter. We want
                                                        a common protocol, but we want diverse languages.
                                                        We want our non-useful life time, the time for the
                                                        river to turn into sea; the time for the sea to turn
                                                        into a river that flies; the time for the river to rain on
                                                        us.</p>

                        <p>Closer to our 7th year of association we had
                            dived into different waters. A lot of people
                            and ideas come and go. While when we
                            started our mission was to connect the
                            unconnected to the internet, we are now
                            reflecting on how to significantly connect
                            the already connected, because connecting
                            people to the shadow of connectivity, just
                            because they "need" to be connected may
                            end up becoming a favor to the lords of the
                            vigilant society of data capitalism.
                            We might be just a drop in the ocean, but
                            the ocean is made of many of us.</p>

                                    opposite direction. deterritorialized technologies are
