## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

Your theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your theme,
run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at
`http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your
theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's
contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content,
your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser
after a refresh, just like normal.

When your theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`,
`_sass` and `assets` tracked with Git will be bundled. To add a custom
directory to your theme-gem, please edit the regexp in
`compost-jekyll-theme.gemspec` accordingly.

If you do not see the images when you compile the site you may need to 
install `git-lfs` on your [distribution](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs). 

After that run it in the repository

```
git lfs fetch
git lfs install
git lfs checkout
```
