<div class="v1_2"><span class="v2_2">The unlimited potentiality of water is always defined by the material reality
    of its surroundings.</span>
<div class="v2_3"></div>
<div class="v2_4"></div>
<div class="v2_6"></div><span class="v2_7">When we define a body of water, we omit its endless states of
    potential being.</span><span class="v2_8">Definition makes us forget how easily we can scoop sea into
    glass.</span><span class="v2_9">But it’s hard to relate to the infinite.</span><span class="v2_11">We seek
    to communicate the singularity of our experience, and it’s the limits and the peculiarities of a thing that
    give it character. The more unique, the more novel, a thing is, the more it will catch our eye.
</span>
<div class="v2_12"></div><span class="v1_3">River, sea, pond, dew — a body of water organizes its particles in
    accordance with the climate and the shape of its vessel.
</span>
<div class="v3_15"></div><span class="v3_17">I was lucky to have a childhood where access to water was abundant.








</span><span class="v10_78">around me. </span><span class="v10_77">gradations of light </span><span
    class="v10_76">transfixed by the shimmering </span><span class="v10_75">immersed in water, I found myself
</span><span class="v10_74">and trips to the beach. Whenever I was</span><span class="v10_73">and I remember
    summers full of swimming lessons </span><span class="v10_72">I grew up on an island in California. My dad
    was a surfer, </span><span class="v3_21">As I set out on my visual studies, I found myself thinking of all
    the bodies of water I have coexisted with.

</span>
<div class="v3_18"></div>
<div class="v3_19"></div><span class="v3_23">And the sharp sparkling clarity of a pool on a scorching day
    is so different from the silky darkness of a redwood forest’s river.</span><span class="v3_24">I used to
    imagine I was a being of water, some aquatic nymph that could receive messages from the tide.</span>
<div class="v3_25"></div>
<div class="v3_26"></div><span class="v3_28">I had a book of fairytales that contained an old version of The
    Little Mermaid; in the end, the soulless mermaid dies and dissolves into seafoam.</span>
<div class="v3_29"></div><span class="v3_30">I thought about what it would be like to have water as my
    body.</span><span class="v3_31">I would lap at an overcast shore until the end of time, the hollow sound of
    waves my only language.</span><span class="v3_32">The image stuck in my mind as a continual fixture;
    somehow, it seemed like a plausible fate for my own life.</span>
<div class="v3_33"></div><span class="v3_34">What would it mean to be an infinite nothingness?</span>
<div class="v3_37"></div><span class="v3_38">Like water, the internet also exists both in its reality and its
    potential.</span><span class="v3_40">The internet could be any form of data shared by a protocol — infinite
    shapes wait to be conjured from the nothingness of cyberspace.</span><span class="v3_42">COMPOST, a
    publication existing on the distributed web, seems like a step into a different virtual reality — an
    uncommon form that makes you dream of things that could be.</span>
<div class="v3_43"></div><span class="v3_45">Yet we rarely look beyond the internet’s common forms: a web page,
    an email, a TikTok. </span>
<div class="v3_46"></div>
<div class="v3_48"></div><span class="v3_49">My drawings are only a series of lines, placed one by one — a
    tangible image slowly created out of intangible thoughts.</span><span class="v3_50">Once a drawing is
    complete, I’m already thinking of the next.
    The drive to imagine what hasn’t yet been made, I think, is inherent in all of us.</span><span
    class="v3_52">It’s hard to imagine a more worthwhile pursuit than one that takes us further and further into
    the unknown,
    forever striving to bring to reality what we see just up ahead.
</span>
<div class="v3_53"></div>
<div class="v3_56"></div><span class="v3_47">Is there anything more fascinating than the process of creation?
    Holding an idea in your mind and taking the steps necessary to see it to fruition?</span>
<div class="v10_79"></div>
<div class="v9_65"></div><span class="v17_4">With this in mind, I began my sketches for COMPOST.
    I like to use simple ways of working, and I wanted to focus on light and shadow, so everything was drawn
    with an 0.7 mechanical pencil in a Rhodia sketchbook.
</span><span class="v17_6">I love texture, but my drawings seem to turn out better on smooth paper. Sometimes I
    add digital texture; lately my favorite method is using a scan of cold pressed watercolor paper as a
    Multiply layer.</span>
