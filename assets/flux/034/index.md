**DESIGNATION: QS47**


Yesterday, I heard familiar human voices in Canadian accented English. Some graduate students and foreign journalists have come to research and cover tin mining in Bangka. They came to have a large dinner at the restaurant. 

You can’t call me an eavesdropper, since my system is purposely built to listen to human inquiries. But this time they never made any requests, and I enjoyed  

just listening to their discussions. 

It seems the entire island of Bangka is sinking just as fast as the city of Jakarta. 

Bangka is the richest tin mining region in the world. Over a third of the world’s supply of this metal comes from Bangka. Tin mining in Bangka[^1] started during the Dutch rule of Indonesia, when the colonial power needed tin to braze their shops and make tin cans. The mining today is propelled by the creation of our kind.  

QS47, tin is in all of us. 

Abandoned mining sites are converted into tourist attractions, just like kelongs, despite containing radioactive metal and being prone to landslides. These sites are even more popular than kelongs, because the white craters — crystal white from a chemical reaction in the mineral-stripped soil — fill up with placid turquoise water. The water is acidic, the white soil is unstable, and the sites contain radioactive metal. But they look like majestic lakes out of a fairytale land so people go out of their way to capture such arresting beauty. 

Bangka island itself is a bedrock of tin, simply waiting to sink once all this tin is extracted. 

Can you believe it, QS47? I am back at my origin point!

[^1]: Onshore mining is carried out within Bangka island and offshore mining conducted by the shores of the island, along with the neighboring Belitung, Kundur, and Riau islands. 
Borehole mining, which uses subsurface hydraulic mining, is a new, environmentally friendly solution for onshore mining which used to strip the soil. There is no new method for offshore mining, but new dredges can excavate up to depths over 110 cubic meters below sea level.
