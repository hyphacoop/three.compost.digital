**Hi Mimi**,


I’m sorry I couldn’t receive your entire message. They had to replace my pump and accumulator last week. Over the weekend, they switched off my system and replaced all my suctions with new ones. 

Oh, Mimi, I have missed you! I have renewed energy and I feel much excitement to solve the troubles of this island. Could you please retransmit your message in its entirety?
