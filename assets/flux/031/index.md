**DESIGNATION: QS47**


Do not worry about me.  I continue to function. 

I have slept with mice, bathed with spiders, swam with slumkids catching snakes among fish and slime and scattered rubbish they had collected to sell to the factories.
Floated along oil-slick water on a corrugated roof that came off until we landed atop a red tile rooftop watching humans swim in their own feces 
and still I am alive. 

My owners never found me. I was taken by the kid in the house I landed on, shoved in a suitcase with the rest of their belongings, and moved to Bangka where they have now settled in a large house with a larger family. 

Twenty-nine people in the family and not one of them knows how to operate or utilize me. I have sat on the corner table of their seafood restaurant across the street like a decorative piece. The restaurant sits on the ~~belong belong~~ kelong, one of the last few in the whole region. Here, I listen to a new language that has not been programmed into my system. I cannot comprehend their speech. I have felt much confusion adapting in this new environment.
