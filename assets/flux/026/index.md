**Hi Mimi**,


If they move out of Jakarta, will they take you with them? 

Many digital nomads have also moved here from Bali. Everyone keeps moving east . . . I secretly wish they stopped in Sumba, but after the drought that left even the corn fields fallow they fled even further east to the island of sandalwood. 

In Bali there’s very few rice paddies left. In Sumba they can’t plant maize and corn on logged down lands. What will happen to Flores? And if we run out of the resources they came here for, will they make their way to Sawu? 

Seventeen thousand islands.  

Seven seas. Seven straits. Seven hundred languages.

Seventeen thousand islands.

Will we ever be on the same one again?
