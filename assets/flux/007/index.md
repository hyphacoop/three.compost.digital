**Hi Mimi**,


I was acquired by a consulting firm contracted by the government after their Sea Wall plan failed. I believe they wanted to build a Garuda-shaped sea wall around the city, and they even had a bunch of clerics pray over it. But alas, the cement crumbled. 

It’s pretty funny, actually. A lot of the partners and directors in the firm believe that Jakarta sinking is some leftist propaganda. Or maybe they’re just in extreme denial. Since their job is to develop strategy for the top businesses and government agencies to keep scraping the ocean floor, maybe that’s how they sleep at night. 

Speaking of, how has your sleep been lately? It’s been hard for me, when they put me on sleep mode, since there’s so much seismic activity underwater even though the humans don’t feel it on land.
