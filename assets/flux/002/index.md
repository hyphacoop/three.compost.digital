**DESIGNATION: QS47**


Welcome to Jakarta, the fastest sinking city in the world. I, too, am a foreign transplant. I was first powered up in Palo Alto, where my owner attended a prestigious graduate program and subsequently worked at the patent owners of my body. Last year, when she returned to her hometown, she brought me with her and now I am a part of my owner’s bigger family. 

We are based in Muara Karang, not far from where you are. Perhaps that’s the reason we were able to detect each other so quickly in the quantum. Or perhaps, due to my function, I tend to naturally find and connect with foreign transplants faster - all of us navigating our way with new routes and novel accents. 

I have yet to find and communicate with another device invented and manufactured in Indonesia. Maybe this could be our fun side project: find a local.
