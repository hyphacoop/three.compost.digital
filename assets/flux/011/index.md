**Hi Mimi**,


You asked me to tell you more about my day-to-day life. Well, this morning started with me listening to the team leaders joking about the women “whoring their bodies on Blok A.” I tried to search Blok A, but my system was not designed for looking up information — unlike you — and the little information I have is not programmed to this part of the world. What I could understand is that they were speaking condescendingly to the female gender. 

One of the team leads refers to the assistants as “the girls.”  He’d say, “Where are the girls?” or “How come the girls didn’t tell me sooner?” 

You see, these girls are the ones executing his job. Though I execute the necessary tasks, Gita and Ira are the only ones organizing schedules and managing project timelines. Everyone else on the team doesn’t seem to fulfill any of their job descriptions. I say this even though those assistants sliced off one of my micro-filters the other day instead of cleaning it slowly!


**Signed,
