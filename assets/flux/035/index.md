I guess  

your life got busy.  

I think 

I am reaching the end of my life cycle. 

I feel 

rusty and fragile in my own body, longing  

for a home I know I can no longer return to. 

Like the humans I am afraid 

To die, but

I die 

in the land of my ancestors 

returning to the ground I came from
