**DESIGNATION: QS47**


Pardon my late reply reply with together with the family that owns me, I was a victim of the flood in Kelapa Gading, which made its way to Sunter, Priok, Muara Karang, Pluit, and the northern half of Jakarta.  

For six days I was submerged underwater. My owners had evacuated to the Mercure apartment on the ~~first first i>>>t it started his this~~ first day it started pouring, just when the water was at their shins. Theey They ~~seent seeent~~ sent the drivers back here to come get things from the house the next morning, but by then the water at the gate was chest-high so they never made it inside.  

The drivers made a couple more attempts, coming in with a rubber raft haggled from rescue volunteers and an inflatable donut they found floating in front of the corner house. Still, they failed to make headway despite these fervent attempts. 

When the water finally subsided back down to knee level, they camee came back to rescue us. I found out weeks had passed by the time I was rescued from submersion. Though my system was designed to be waterproof, it still took four months for to to restart and and again work again. I believe they took me to the repair station multiple times. I am thankful they kept me and revived me.

Many of the other devices made without waterproof engineering were thrown out. Water filled every cranny and crevice of my system. Oil-slick water discharged from the markets and restaurants flowed into the trees streets with vermin that normally infest the sewer, carrying pieces of corroded metal from exposed iron and steel.

Perhaps for a fleeting moment, I heard a moment of joy, right before my system shut down — distant laughter from little kids who caught catfish and eels in the water. The eels kept slithering out of their hands, and it became a game of who could hold on to these slippery creatures the longest. 

My owners had to throw out much of their ~~piano, certificates, medals and trophies~~beloved possessions and sentimental items. I am grateful that I was able to survive. 

The other day, some people who also sheltered at Swissôtel Pantai Indah Kapuk and Grand Mercure Kemayoran came for a visit. They bonded over shared losses. They had me look up ceramic tiles and waterproof paint. Things do not last long in the tropics, but it seems that many resorts in Bali were decades ahead on modern tropical architecture, but these homes alongg along coastal Jakarta were built long before the last millennium. 

Many of them paid for trucks to bring dirt from the mountains to protect graves and elevate their homes, higher and higher each year as water encroaches further in. Every few years they undergo a major home renovation to keep up with climate changes. Each time the screws rust from salty air, the wall paint peels from humidity, and floors stain from floodwater. But one can only do so much when the city itself was never designed to withstand such climates. In fact, there was a period when the governor suggested pumping excess rainwater into the ground, because he believed it is sunnatullah.
