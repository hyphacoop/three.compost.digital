I made it back to Jakarta. We flew to Garut where the new airport had been built on the reclaimed lands around Mount Papandayan, now extinct and near sea level, before taking a private boat to Jakarta. 

Jakarta has drowned and for two decades she was claimed by the sea, until the government engaged architects who made Palm Jumeirah and Jebel Ali to design a semi-Atlantis.

It is no longer tropical architecture, but underwater architecture. Human visitors browse malls and museums in canoes. Hotels are designed to integrate the liquid environment. Romantic cafes sit on tall concrete stilts so perhaps you could call them kelongs, redesigned for the new tourist economy. Land is a forgotten concept, and nobody resides in Jakarta. The humans who did live in Jakarta were all safely relocated to the highlands of Papua. They were able preserve the Betawi culture in these places, even integrating with the Hubula, Yali and Lani cultures. 

They briefly attempted the digital nation route, modeled from Tuvalu. But unlike the island microstate, it was impossible to digitize even one city. Jakarta was too populous and too diverse, with too many cultures coming and going, mixing and fusing. It would be impossible to upload all that data onto a cable.

Japan and the Netherlands never fully acknowledged the occupation and colonization of Indonesia, but at least they dispatched a fair amount of aid to the state to build a temporary wall. Japan had helped design the mass rapid transit system before Jakarta sank, and they recycled the same slabs of concrete and heat-treated carbon steel rods for the wall. 

For a moment, the Indonesian government revisited their Garuda-shaped sea wall dreams from many administrations ago, but eventually abandoned it again when they realized that the top 1% have relocated to Australia and Aotearoa and there was not enough financial activity to justify such a large investment. They also attempted several large-scale experiments, such as transplanting the mangroves from the Thousand Islands north of Jakarta’s coast. Alas, the only way to save Jakarta was to conduct a complete redesign and restructure the city’s water system, but this was impossible for the humans to achieve. 

I am also nearing the end of my lifespan, as the consultants no longer know what to do with me. An unnatural end, as I am no longer needed. After they terminate me, they will send me to Palo Alto, where the engineers will take me apart and study individual components for research and development. 

We never made it back together, but I will be going to where you came from, and perhaps in a roundabout way we both got to where we wanted to be.
