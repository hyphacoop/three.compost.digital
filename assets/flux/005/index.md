Hi Mimi,

That may be technically true. But I was made to serve everyone. My makers did start out creating previous generations for narrower uses, but we have evolved not only to purify seawater into potable water, but also to siphon water in copious amounts to stabilize sea levels. If I am successful, they will ship more of us straight from Tampico to fix this issue. We may become to Indonesia what the windmills are to the Netherlands. A fixture of survival for their people.
