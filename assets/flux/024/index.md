**Hi Mimi**, 


Unlike you, I cannot communicate with humans — my system has not been scripted with a language comprehensible by humans.
I can simply observe, often with blurred vissons visoons visions and static murmurs when my system is deteriorating. There are suspended solids and microplastics stuck inside me and other compounds that have come loose.  

The water being pumped here is different and has been degrading my system more rapidly. My limbs are numb and severely swollen. It’s like I’m shapeshifting . . .  


**Signed,
