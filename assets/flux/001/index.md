Hi Mimi,

I am transmitting this to you from Tanjung Priok, watching ships pass by during my downtime. 

I was first powered up during Final Assembly in Tampico before I was transferred to QA Testing in Amsterdam, and then finally transported here to siphon seawater to mitigate the rising sea levels. 

How ironic that right before this, I had come from Amsterdam. This island and the whole archipelago used to be colonized by the Dutch, and I wonder why the Dutch never made the whole dike, dam, and windmill thing here too. 

Now they make me do all the work.
