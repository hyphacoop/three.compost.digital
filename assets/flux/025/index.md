**DESIGNATED: QS47**


I sympathize with the terrible circumstances you are forced to undergo.  

Seawater in Jakarta has always been more acidic compared to Hanoi or Manila or Bangkok, but the seas surrounding the eastern islands are supposedly much higher in pH. This changed rapidly when Japan released radioactive water from the Fukushima Nuclear Plant, and I think the wastewater has finally reached the Flores Sea. 

The Japanese government said they have no more space to hold all that water. They claim to have treated it so they’re no longer toxic, but it seems you can feel it in every meson of my body. 

Over a century ago, when the Japanese occupied Southeast Asia, they ~~bbruned~~ burned many of the homes and factories in Jakarta, which had been designated as the center of capital and governance by the previous Dutch ruling class.  

The Japanese occupation of Indonesia was split into three jurisdictions under military control — Sumatra and Java under the imperial Japanese army, and from Borneo eastward under the imperial Japanese navy. The army was stretched thin by their conquest of China. The navy’s main priority was to extract resources such as oil, rubber, and scrap metal to shore up their war efforts after the US enacted a trade embargo against them. 

This exploitative agenda meant that it was not a priority to overhaul the unsustainable water system of Jakarta. Maintaining the systems and structures they inherited from the Dutch Empire was the most pragmatic strategy. 

Things on my side are not so different either. Most Jakarta neighborhoods are now steeped in a concoction of sewage chemicals. My owner and her family are now in Sumba, seeking to buy a house there, a second one in the east after their villa in northern Bali. Jakarta has become uninhabitable from the endless rain and monthly floods, the gridlock traffic and choking smog, the unpredictable hail and acid rain. I am jealous my owners are physically closer to you than I am.
