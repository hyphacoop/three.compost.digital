**Dear Mimi**,


Forgive me.  

They moved me east to Flores. Instead of sucking seawater, they now want me to create powerful ocean waves here. They say it’s for the adrenaline junkies who come here for extreme water sports. 

I’m with the same group of humans, but they’re with a new company now, building several eco-resorts like they did in Sumba. This is better work. They upgraded my internal software and replaced all the hardware with new components. Plus, I like ending the night in peace and quiet while the humans enjoy grilled fish without alcohol, unlike benumbed Jakarta, after a day of jet-skiing and fly-boarding. 

I actually met a person today. She is an interesting one. She kept going on and on about how people from China used to come to the island, selling bootleg alcohol to underage kids. And that the kids would spend their days drinking themselves to stupor, then pound on her door in the evening, calling out her name in slurred speech. Which is why she keeps a knife right beside her pillow. And also why she hates the Chinese.  

“It’s the fault of the Chinese people!” she screamed repeatedly, “Clearly they’ve infiltrated all the islands in Indonesia! Even Malaysia! Doing their dirty business that ruins our nation!”
