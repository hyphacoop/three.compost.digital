Kelongs are fishing platforms that used to exist all over islands in Southeast Asia. They’re built on wooden stilts over shallow waters. Fishermen would sit on the edge, smoking kretek as they farm their fish.

Then, overfishing developed as commercial expansion entered rural islands. The rural inhabitants left for the big cities, and the companies from Jakarta sent their people to clean up the remaining unused land. 

These days you don’t see people fish for themselves anymore. Everything is for a major company now. Most kelongs have vanished and only exist in old photographs. 

And these abandoned kelongs get reinvented as . . .  

Can you guess?


Tourist attractions. 

The shacks get repurposed as seafood restaurants, or they build a new restaurant and renovate the little shacks into souvenir stores. The visitors can walk out to the boardwalk that juts into the ocean.  

When tourists were far and few, the local villages were fine. The visitors would come, devour creatures of the ocean, complain about vicious mosquitoes, and get shocked by mischievous monkeys. Then they’d leave, after spending money on the island. The local people were happy, and they got to meet new people. 

But with all successful ventures, outsiders come preying for investment opportunities. The islands became megaprojects for tourism. One by one the humble kelongs disappeared.
