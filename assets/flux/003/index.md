Hi Mimi,

Can you believe my tentacles are already clogged? It hasn’t even been 48 hours! The water is not just cloudy, it’s not really water at all, but sunscreen and gasoline filled with soot. Not just Cheetos bags and Aqua bottles, but a bunch of poopy diapers and used pads floating in the water!  

I have these painful bumps all over me. One of the technicians tried to scrape them off with a bark, but she ended up damaging the pump. You know, I am afraid I won’t last long. I fear my lever will crack. My membranes will disintegrate. My filters will clog. My relief valve will collapse. 

Mimi, do you know how long my design normally lasts in these conditions? And how about yours?
